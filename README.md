# Weather Monitoring System

## Description
This project is a Python-based weather monitoring system that fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities, alerts users via email when temperatures exceed a specified threshold, and aggregates daily weather data for visualization. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data and stores daily summaries in a MongoDB database.

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities.
- Sends email alerts when temperatures exceed a defined threshold.
- Aggregates daily weather data for average, max, and min temperatures.
- Visualizes weather trends using Matplotlib.
- Stores daily summaries in MongoDB.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenWeatherMap API
- MongoDB
- Matplotlib
- `schedule` for periodic tasks

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- MongoDB
- An OpenWeatherMap API key
